## Bugs

When I first deplyed my project the images didn't show. I fixed this by usiing a relative link on each image ./assets/images/site-logo.jpg
There are no unfixed bugs.

## Validator testing
HTML - used [W3 Validation Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org) to test my site. It showed broken broken links, which I was able to fix.

CSS - used [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to test my CSS. I had added the link to Google Fonts instead of the import link.

Accessability - The site was run through Lighthouse and confirms a 100% score for accessability.
